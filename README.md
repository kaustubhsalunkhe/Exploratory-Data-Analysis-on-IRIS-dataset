# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-on-IRIS-dataset
Overview
The Iris dataset is one of the most well-known datasets in the machine learning and data analysis community. It contains measurements of iris flowers across three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. This project involves performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Iris dataset to gain insights into its structure, relationships, and distributions.

Objectives
Understand the structure of the dataset.
Summarize key statistics for each feature.
Visualize relationships between features.
Identify patterns and correlations in the data.
Prepare the dataset for further analysis or modeling.
Dataset Information
Source: Fisher's Iris dataset
Number of Instances: 150
Number of Features: 4 (Sepal Length, Sepal Width, Petal Length, Petal Width)
Number of Classes: 3 (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica)
Steps Performed
Loading the Dataset
Imported the dataset from:

Built-in libraries like scikit-learn or seaborn.
CSV file, if provided separately.
Data Overview

Displayed the first few rows of the dataset.
Checked for missing values, data types, and basic structure.
Summary Statistics

Calculated mean, median, standard deviation, and other descriptive statistics for numerical features.
Compared statistics across different species.
Data Visualizations
Created plots to explore the dataset visually:

Histograms: Distribution of each feature.
Box Plots: Variance and outliers in features grouped by species.
Pair Plots: Relationships between features across species.
Correlation Heatmap: Correlations between numerical features.
Scatter Plots: Class-specific separability of features.
Insights & Findings

Highlighted features with strong class-separating power (e.g., Petal Length and Petal Width).
Discussed patterns and trends observed in the data.
Tools & Libraries Used
Programming Language: Python
Libraries:
pandas for data manipulation and analysis.
matplotlib and seaborn for data visualization.
numpy for numerical operations.
Outputs
Plots and Visualizations:
Save visualizations to the plots/ directory (if applicable).
Include the key plots in this repository.
Statistical Summaries:
Saved as eda_summary.csv.
How to Use
Setup Environment
Install dependencies:

bash
Copy code
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn numpy
Run the Script
Execute the EDA script:

bash
Copy code
python iris_eda.py
Review Results

Generated plots will be stored in the outputs/ directory.
View the descriptive statistics and insights in the terminal or the eda_summary.csv file.
Key Insights
Setosa is easily separable from the other two classes based on Petal Length and Petal Width.
Versicolor and Virginica overlap in some features but can be distinguished with combination metrics.
Sepal features are less discriminative compared to petal features.
Next Steps
Use insights gained from EDA to preprocess data for machine learning models.
Explore feature engineering or dimensionality reduction techniques.
Build a classification model to predict the species of an iris flower based on its features.
